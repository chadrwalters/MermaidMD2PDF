# Workflow Testing Process

## Branch Structure

### Main Branches
- `main`: Production branch with stable workflows
- `workflow-improvements`: Base branch for workflow development

### Feature Branches
All workflow improvements should be developed in feature branches following this pattern:
- `workflow/feature-name`: For new features
- `workflow/fix-name`: For bug fixes
- `workflow/optimize-name`: For performance improvements

Example:
- `workflow/add-timeouts`
- `workflow/fix-cache-keys`
- `workflow/optimize-matrix`

## Branch Protection Rules

### workflow-improvements Branch
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require up-to-date branches before merging
- Allow force pushes (for workflow development)
- Allow deletions (for cleanup)

### Feature Branches
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require up-to-date branches before merging
- No force pushes allowed
- No deletions allowed

## Testing Process

### 1. Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from `workflow-improvements`
   ```bash
   git checkout workflow-improvements
   git pull origin workflow-improvements
   git checkout -b workflow/feature-name
   ```

2. Make changes to workflow files
3. Test locally using `act` or GitHub Actions
4. Commit changes with descriptive messages
5. Push to remote
   ```bash
   git push origin workflow/feature-name
   ```

### 2. Pull Request Process
1. Create pull request to `workflow-improvements`
2. Ensure all checks pass
3. Get code review
4. Address feedback
5. Merge when approved

### 3. Integration Testing
1. After merging to `workflow-improvements`:
   - Run full workflow suite
   - Verify all jobs complete successfully
   - Check performance metrics
   - Document any issues

### 4. Production Deployment
1. Create pull request from `workflow-improvements` to `main`
2. Ensure all checks pass
3. Get final review
4. Deploy to production

## Rollback Process

### Quick Rollback
If issues are detected immediately:
1. Revert the merge commit
2. Push the revert
3. Document the issue

### Emergency Fix
If immediate fix is needed:
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`
2. Apply fix
3. Create pull request to both `main` and `workflow-improvements`
4. Merge both pull requests
5. Delete hotfix branch

## Best Practices

### Workflow Development
1. Test changes locally first
2. Use `act` for local testing
3. Keep changes focused and small
4. Document all changes
5. Update tests as needed

### Code Review
1. Review workflow syntax
2. Check security implications
3. Verify performance impact
4. Ensure proper error handling
5. Validate documentation updates

### Documentation
1. Update workflow documentation
2. Document any new dependencies
3. Update testing procedures
4. Maintain changelog
5. Update troubleshooting guide
